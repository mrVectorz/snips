# SNIPS
This is a collection of non-serious stuff. I will have a random collection of scripts that I want to keep for now.

#### OSP
Few openstack scripts I want public facing so clients can easily get them.

#### UTILS
Quick one off scripts that can be used in various environments.

#### jupyter
Jupyter notebooks environment setup.
